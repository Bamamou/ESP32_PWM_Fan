## ESP32 and 12V PWM Fan
 This is a simple PWM control technic of a 4-Pin fan using temperature read from a DHT11 by ESP32 to control the cooling system of an old desktop. <br>
 you can change it with your desired temp sensor.<br>
 Do not forget to change the min and max termp accordingly.<br>
 Pay attention to the pins, resolution, and frequency.
 ### Pin layout
 Please look at the code 
 ### How to use the code
 It is self explanatory because it is simple enough to understand
 ### Depencies
 Just VS Code with plaformio 
 ### Hardware 
 12V power supply<br>
 ESP32 dev board
 12VDC Fan with PWM (4 wires)
 DHT11/DHT22 or any temp probe
